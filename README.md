# Clump-Finding-Problem

Given integers L and t, a string Pattern forms an (L, t)-clump inside a (larger) string Genome if there is an interval of Genome of length L in which Pattern appears at least t times. For example, TGCA forms a (25,3)-clump in the following Genome: gatcagcataagggtccc**TGCA**A**TGCA**TGACAAGCC**TGCA**gttgttttac.Find patterns forming clumps in a string.
